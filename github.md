<h1> The github assignment for Advanced Data Reporting class </h1>

Exploring the data projects of the Los Angeles Times Data Desk, I found very interesting project https://github.com/datadesk/Chartbuilder which was forked from Quartz/Chartbuilder.
According to the description, "Chartbuilder is a front-end charting application that facilitates easy creation of simple beautiful charts. Chartbuilder is the user and export interface. D4 is the default charting framework. Chartbuilder powers all chart creation on Atlas, a charting platform developed by Quartz." It is important to note that users are able to make a mobile friendly responsive chart which will work for different devices.

I checked it and found it extremely useful for journalists who are seeking for the tools to visualize their data. I found the new version of the project where you can have more control on your data charts. The previous version of the project is located here http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/ and was created by Quartz. The interface looks pretty easy to understand and make it possible to use for people without rich coding experience. There is also a website https://www.theatlas.com where you can produce nice infographics.

I would ask the authors of the project how they built it and is it possible to create the similar tool for mapping, for example. It would be great.
